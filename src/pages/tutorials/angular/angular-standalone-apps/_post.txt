#angular #standalone #component 

The only way to create an application before Angular 14 was by using Angular ngModules, that are a great way to organize applications in groups of components, directive, pipes and services.

Every Angular application must have at least one module, usually named AppModule, and known as Root Module, and each route can be associated to a module in order to be lazy loaded.



Angular 14 and above now provides a new way to create applications by using components only (aka Standalone Components).



The application can now run by bootstrapping a component instead of the Root Module and router can be configured to lazy load standalone components.



So, in this post you can see how it works and read the whole article, with more tips, on my blog .
