#new_blog #angular #tutorial #beginner
I finally have a new blog in which I will mainly publish two types of content:
➡️ Snippets, Quick Posts, Notes
➡️ Step-by-Step Tutorials that you can use to practice and learn stuff
It's completely built from scratch in Astro and Tailwind and I will talk about it in another post.
Anyway today I want to share the first tutorial about Angular for absolute beginners, and I would like to test the blog too. 

If you have never used Angular this is a good starting point.
In this step-by-step tutorial you will learn:
➡️ How to use a code playground (StackBlitz)
➡️ what is the interpolation
➡️ the differences between attribute and structural directives 
➡️ familiarize yourself with Angular.

So you will develop your first hello world web application in Angular (v.15) by the creation of a simple counter. 
You will learn how to create dinamic HTML templates, work with CSS, the concept of interpolation, the differences between attribute / structural directives and familiarize yourself with the framework.
