# TOPICS

# Goal 

Create an application to manage a list of users by using the following concepts:

* Angular framework directives: `ngIf`, `ngFor`
* Dynamic Styling
* Form and validations
* Create a Fake REST server to create "real-world" examples
* `HTTPClient` and how to consume REST API services
* Dependency Injection and State management with services

Following you can see the result you'll get at the end of the tutorial

<Hint title="First time using Angular?">
  Probably you should start from my [Angular Hello World Tutorial](/tutorials/angular/angular-basics/1-angular-hello-world)
</Hint>

# Requirements

The only requirements you need to make this exercise is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or above

<Hint title="TIPS: multiple Node versions">
  if you need to install multiple versions of Node on your machine you might want to consider tools like **nvm** (node version manager). You could then have an Angular 10 project running on Node 12 and one with React that requires Node 18 at the same time.

# Create an Angular project with Angular CLI

Open the terminal, go to the folder in which you would like to create a new Angular project and type the following command:

<Code>
```bash
 npx -p @angular/cli@latest ng new demo1  -s -t -S
```
</Code>

When asked:

* _Ok to proceed?_: Type `y`
* _Would you like to add Angular routing?_: `No`
* _Which stylesheet format would you like to use_: Use arrows and select `CSS`

<Img src={import('./images/2022-12-11-22-27-10.png')} w={800} quality={60} border/>


<Hint title="What is NPX?">
The `npx` (Node Package eXecute) is an NPM package runner and it's automatically installed with Node and NPM.

It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it.
So we use this command to download the latest Angular version, install all the dependencies and create a new project named `demo1`

<Code>
```
npx -p @angular/cli@latest ng new demo1  -s -t -S
```
</Code>

Other parameters:

* `-t`: enable inline templates instead of create external HTML files for components
* `-s`: enable inline styles 
* `-S`: skip (unit) tests
<br />

**Why do we set these parameters?**
<br />
In Angular you can define the HTML and CSS in external files or, if you prefer, you can integrate them directly into the component.
I prefer the latter solution because, in this way, we avoid too many files inside the application. 
It's a personal choice that not everyone likes so I suggest you use it to complete this tutorial and you can always switch to external templates in future projects.
</Hint>




Now you can open the terminal and run the project you have just created:

<Code>
```bash
cd demo1           # go to project folder
npm start          # run project ... wait some seconds
```
</Code>



### Check if it works

After the project compilation, you can navigate to [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200)  and open the project in your favorite browser to get a preview. I suggest to use Chrome (or Firefox).

<Hint type="empty" title="TIP">
When you are creating an application:

1) Check the terminal for compilation errors 
2) **you should always keep opened browser DevTools to check if there are runtime errors**, as shown in the image below<br />
<Img isWindowed={false} src={import('./images/image (24).png')} w={600} quality={60} border align="center"/>
</Hint>


# Project Structure

Your project structure should look like to the following:

<Img src={import('./images/image (9).png')} w={300} quality={80} border/>

# Install Bootstrap and font-awesome

Open your terminal and kill the current process by pressing <Key>CTRL</Key> + <Key>C</Key> (probably you need to press it a couple of times).

Now you can install a couple of libraries by using some [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages:

*  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): a CSS framework useful to quickly create HTML layouts
*  [Font Awesome (4.7)](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/): a set of free icons

Make sure you're in the project **root folder** and run the following command:

<Code>
```bash
npm install bootstrap font-awesome
```
</Code>



<Hint title="How can I be sure I'm the root folder?">
  You're in the root file if it contains the `package.json` file. <br />
  Use `dir`  command (Windows) or `ls` (Mac/Linux) to display the list of files:
  <Img isWindowed={false} src={import('./images/2022-12-11-22-36-13.png')} w={700} quality={60} border align="center"/>
</Hint>


## Global CSS

Our goal is that all Bootstrap/FontAWesome CSS classes are globally available in our application. 

The easiest way to include them is our project is by opening the `angular.json` file and update the `architect.build.styles` property.

So, open `angular.json` (you can find it in the project root folder) and recognize the `styles` property:

<Code title="<code>angular.json</code>">
```javascript
  // ...
  "architect": {
    "build": {
      // ...
      "options": {
        // ...
        "styles": [     // <=== HERE
          "src/styles.css"
        ],  
      }
    }
    // ...
  }
```
</Code>

And now you can add the path of the minified CSS versions of the framework you have just installed:

<Code title="<code>angular.json</code>">
```json
{
  // ...
  "styles": [
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css",
    "src/styles.css"
  ],
  // ...
}
```
</Code>


<Hint title="How did I find the path to include in `angular.json`">
  You just need to open your `node_modules` folder, search the `bootstrap` or `font-awesome` folders and find the file path:
<Img isWindowed={false} src={import('./images/2022-12-11-22-48-17.png')} w={400} quality={60} border align="center"/>

</Hint>



### Check if it works

Now you just need to check if Bootstrap and FontAwesome are properly configured.


<Hint type="alert">
You have to kill the Angular CLI process by pressing <Key>CTRL</Key> + <Key>C</Key> and run `npm start` again to apply the changes you have done in `angular.json`.
</Hint>


Open `src/app.component.ts` and replace all the HTML template content with the following one:

<Code techs={['angular']} title="<code>app.component.ts</code>">
```html
template: `
  <button class="btn btn-success">
    <i class="fa fa-times"></i>
  </button>
`
```
</Code>


<Hint title="VISUAL STUDIO CODE TIPS">
Some IDE such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) supports Angular inline template out of the box.

[Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) doesn't support them.

So I suggest to install the `angular2-inline` extension from the VSC marketplace
  <Img isWindowed={false} src={import('./images/2022-12-15-12-26-41.png')} w={500} quality={60} border align="center"/>

  Anyway I also suggest to install the `Angular Service` extension or, much better, `Angular Essential` by John Papa (a pack of extensions thats already includes it and several other useful extensions for Angular)
  
  <Img isWindowed={false} src={import('./images/2022-12-15-12-29-14.png')} w={500} quality={60} border align="center"/>

</Hint>

Now you can save your work, wait a moment and you should see the following output in your browser (a green button with an <Key>x</Key> inside it):

<Img  src={import('./images/image (25).png')} w={500} quality={60} border align="center"/>


<Hint>
You can now remove the `<button>` you have just created. It was just a test to check if libraries are properly configured ðŸ˜…
</Hint>


So the `AppComponent` HTML template should now be empty or just contain a placeholder like an "Hello":

<Code techs={['angular']} title="<code>app.component.ts</code>">
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <h1>Hello</h1>
  `,
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'demo1';
}
```
</Code>

Try it on [`http://localhost:4200`](https://localhost:4200) or use the interactive code playground below:


<Img src={import('./images/image (26).png')} w={600} quality={60} border align="center"/>
